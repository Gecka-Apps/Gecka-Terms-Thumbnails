== Description ==

Have you ever wanted to have thumbnails support for your categories? Have you ever used a plugin that implements some sort of custom taxonomy or custom categories but no thumbnail support?

Then, that plugin is for you. Using it you can manage the images thumbnails of your categories. But not only, you can set it to enable thumbnails for any other taxonomy's terms, even taxonomies created by other plugins.

By default, it is enabled for your posts categories. If you want to order any other taxonomy, or add other thumbnail sizes, go read <a href="http://gecka-apps.com/wordpress-plugins/terms-thumbnails/">the plugin's page on our website</a>.
